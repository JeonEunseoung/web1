  <h2>방탄소년단이란</h2>

  <p>Last month, BTS became the "first group with a trio of No. 1 entrances" with its songs "Dynamite," "Life Goes On" and "Butter."

BTS has been refreshing its list of accolades after becoming the first Korean act to debut at No. 1 on the Hot 100 with "Dynamite" in 2020. The group's first English language single also earned its first Grammy nomination.

Later in the year, "Life Goes On," the main track for its album "BE," became the first song predominantly sung in Korean to debut at the top spot on the main singles chart.

When including the group's overall No. 1 songs on the Billboard Hot 100, "Butter" is the fourth song to sit atop the main singles chart.</p>
